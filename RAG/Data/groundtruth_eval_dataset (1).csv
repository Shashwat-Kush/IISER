Abstract
Recently, retrieval-augmented text generation
attracted increasing attention of the compu-
tational linguistics community.
Compared
with conventional generation models, retrieval-
augmented text generation has remarkable ad-
vantages and particularly has achieved state-of-
the-art performance in many NLP tasks. This
paper aims to conduct a survey about retrieval-
augmented text generation. It ﬁrstly highlights
the generic paradigm of retrieval-augmented","The notable approaches to retrieval-augmented text generation reviewed in the paper are: (1) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for dialogue response generation, (2) Retrieval-Augmented Machine Translation (RAMT) for machine translation, and (3) Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation (RATG) for other generation tasks."
"What are the advantages of the retrieval-augmented text generation paradigm over generation-based counter-parts, as mentioned in the paper?","nology, has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) per-
formance in many NLP tasks and attracted the at-
tention of the computational linguistics community
(Weston et al., 2018; Dinan et al., 2018; Cai et al.,
2021). Compared with generation-based counter-
part, this new paradigm has some remarkable ad-
vantages: 1) The knowledge is not necessary to be
implicitly stored in model parameters, but is explic-
itly acquired in a plug-and-play manner, leading","The knowledge is not necessary to be implicitly stored in model parameters, but is explicitly acquired in a plug-and-play manner, leading to remarkable advantages."
"What are the two primary advantages of retrieval-augmented text generation mentioned in the paper, and how do they contribute to its scalability and effectiveness?","vantages: 1) The knowledge is not necessary to be
implicitly stored in model parameters, but is explic-
itly acquired in a plug-and-play manner, leading
to great scalibility; 2) Instead of generating from
scratch, the paradigm generating text from some re-
trieved human-written reference, which potentially
alleviates the difﬁculty of text generation.
This paper aims to review many representative
approaches for retrieval-augmented text generation
tasks including dialogue response generation (We-","The two primary advantages of retrieval-augmented text generation mentioned in the paper are: 1) The knowledge is not necessary to be implicitly stored in model parameters, but is explicitly acquired in a plug-and-play manner, leading to great scalability; 2) Instead of generating from scratch, the paradigm generating text from some retrieved human-written reference, which potentially alleviates the difficulty of text generation."

interest in knowledge-grounded generation explor-
ing different forms of knowledge such as knowl-
edge bases and external documents (Dinan et al.,
2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Lian et al., 2019; Li et al.,
2019; Qin et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021; Zhang et al.,
2021). On the machine translation task, we summa-
rize the early work on how the retrieved sentences
(called translation memory) are used to improve","According to the authors of this survey, the primary advantages of retrieval-augmented text generation compared to conventional generation models are its ability to leverage external knowledge and its ability to generate more informative and accurate text."
