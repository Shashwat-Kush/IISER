I give the se questions that most people have in mind, and the answers \\nbased on the Bhagavad -Gita, using simple language.  \\nTranslation of the Bhagavad -Gita verses from Sanskrit to English were prepared with \\nhelp from others , without dev iating from the original message of Lord Krishna and \\nSwami Srila Prabhupadas’ teachings. The translations of the Srimad -Bhagavatam and \\nCaitanya -caritamrta Sanskrit verses into English are courtesy of the Bhaktivedanta \\nBook Trust International, www.krishna. com. \\nThe focus of this book is on the message of Lord Krishna to humanity and so I have \\nomitted the statements in the translations, which address Arjuna, like ‘O Arjuna’, ‘O \\nson of Kunti’, ‘My dear Arjuna’,’O son of Bharata’ and so on.

What is the history of the Bhagavad -Gita?   \\nUnlike the non -Vedic scriptures (scriptures from outside India), the Bhagavad -Gita, \\nis not a one-off scripture, it’s eternal. It was last  spoken 5000 years ago by Lord \\nKrishna to Arjuna, and 120.533 million years ago to the person who maintains the \\nsun planet, Vivas van. It was first spoken in this universe, 155.522 trillion years ago.  \\n“I gave this science of self -realization knowledge to V ivasvan, and he gave \\nit to Manu, and Manu gave the knowledge to his son, Iksvaku.” (Lord \\nKrishna, Bhagavad -Gita 4.1)  \\nVivasv an is a demigod who maintains the sun planet. Demigods are very powerful \\nhuman beings, they are NOT the Supreme ( Not God). \\n“Although I am unborn, imperishable, eternal, and the Lord of all living \\nbeings, using My internal energy, I still appear in My original spiritual form.” \\n(Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -Gita 4.6) \\nLord Krishna appears once on this planet in His original form, once in every d aytime \\nof Brahma, which is every 8.64 billion years, and each time the Bhagavad -Gita is \\nspoken by Him. So far in the current cosmic cycle, Lord Krishna has appeared and \\nspoken the Bhagavad -Gita more than 18,000 times on this planet ( age of \\nuniverse/ timing of appearance= 155.522 trillion/8.64 billion). This is how great Lord \\nKrishna (God), His teachings, and the Bhagavad -Gita are.  \\n“Once in a day of Brahma, He descends to this world to manifest His \\ntranscendental pastimes.” (Caitanya -caritamrta Adi -Lila 3.6)  \\nThe Bhagavad -Gita has been spoken by Lord Krishna in millions of other universes. It \\nis continuously being spoken at every second. This means that it’s being spoken right \\nnow in some universe.  \\n“The consecutive pastimes of Krsna are being manifested in one  of the \\ninnumerable  universes moment after moment. There is no possibility of \\ncounting the universes, but in  any case, some pastime of the Lord is being \\nmanifested at every moment in one universe  or another.” (Sri Ca itanya -\\ncaritamrta Madhya -Lila 20.382)  \\n \\n“Since all Krsna’s pastimes are taking place continuously, at every moment \\nsome pastime  is existing in one universe or another. Consequently, these \\npastimes are called eternal by  the Vedas and Puranas.” (Sri Ca itanya -\\ncaritamrta Madhya -Lila 20.395)  \\n \\nThe spea king of the Bhagavad -Gita is the greatest pastime of Lord Krishna which is for \\nour benefit.

Does the Bhagavad -Gita state  that those who don’t follow it go to hell?  \\n \\nNo. The Bhagavad -Gita clearly teaches that eventually every soul will get liberation. \\nThis is because, every soul belongs to God.  \\n \\nOne of the differences between the Bhagavad -Gita and the Non-Vedic scriptures is \\nthat the God of the Bhagavad -Gita is a responsible, mature, loving, and caring \\nperson. He is not a bully, hater, curser, nor child ish. \\n“I hate no one. I am equal to all living beings…\" (Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -\\nGita 9.29)  \\n“…One who has no enemies among all living beings comes to Me.”  (Lord \\nKrishna,  Bhagavad -Gita 11.55)  \\n“One who is compassionate to all living beings … - These are some of the \\nqualities of  those born with divine nature.” (Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -Gita \\n16.1-3) \\nThe fact that the people of various religions exist is the simple proof that it is God’s \\nwill that they exist . God is the creator of all living beings.  \\n \\nI have come ac ross many in my life who say that I will go to hell because I don’t \\nfollow their religion. They think that God made a mistake by creating those who don’t \\nfollow their religion. They clearly don’t understand that God is in full control, \\ninfallible, and thus  all living beings have the right to exist  by the will of God . Some \\npeople think that God is testing us by creating people of various relig ions to see who \\nconverts. This is a non -sense ideology because the eternal God is omniscient. He \\nknows the past, pres ent, and the future of everyone, and we are not animals in a \\nlaboratory that need testing. God has been creating people eternally on this planet in \\nthis universe and on other planets in millions of other universes. It is foolish to think \\nthat God has only recently created His religion.  God is eternal,  and His religion is also \\neternal, Sanatan -Dharma.  \\n“I am transcendental, beyond the fallible and infallible, and because I am \\nthe greatest, I  am celebrated as the Supreme person, on the material, and \\nspiritual planets, and in the  Vedas.” (Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -Gita 15.18)  \\n6.

God sustains all \\nliving beings, because they are His children.  \\n• Does the sun only give light to the followers of one religion?

What is religion?  \\n \\nTo follow the teachings  or laws of God is called religion. Since God is eternal, His \\nteachings must also be eternal, and thus the religion of God must also be eternal.  \\n• God is eternal, meaning He has always  existed  \\n• If God has eternally exist ed, then man must also have eternally existed. Why \\nwould God live alone?  \\n• The teachings/ laws created by God for man to follow must have eternally existed  \\nThat eternal religion which was create d by the eternal God is called “Sanatan -\\nDharma ”, which literally means the ‘Eternal Religion’, and referred to  as the Vedic \\nreligion or pure Hinduism. The eternal teachings of God are contained in the Vedic \\nScriptures.  \\nThe highest form of religion is that by which one becomes fully conscious of the \\nexistence of God, including His form, name, qualities, pastimes, abode and all -\\npervasive features. When everything is completely known, that is the perfection of \\nreligious  knowledge , and this can only be achieved  by the Vedic knowledge . God is \\nnot described in the non -Vedic scriptures.  \\nThe Vedic religion has been proven to be the oldest on the planet, and the oldest \\nscriptures on the planet are the Vedic scriptures, which were written in the oldest \\nlanguage known to man, Sanskrit. Sanskrit is known to be the most systematic \\nlanguage on the planet, the best language.  \\n“You are the Supreme person, eternal, imperishable, inexhaustible, the \\nsustainer of the  eternal religion. You are the basis of this universe.” (Arjuna  \\nto Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -Gita 11.18)  \\nIt is only Lord Krishna who is eternally known as the supreme person, God. All other \\nso-called Gods are recent man -made creations and they have not exhibit ed the \\nqualities of God. Only Lord Krishna has so far proved Himself to be the one true God.  \\n10. What is the purpose of religion?  \\n \\nThe purpose of religion is to know, serve, and love God. But you can only serve and \\nlove someone, if you know him or her. You cannot serve or love an invisible or \\nunknown person . Only the  Vedic scriptures describe exactly who the person God is. \\nThe non -Vedic scriptures don't have a clue as to who God is. Serving and loving God \\nincludes serving and loving all the creatures of God. This means serving and loving \\nall human  beings  and animals. You should not hurt or eat any of our brothers and \\nsisters . The animals are also our brothers and sisters.  \\n“Being freed from attachments, fear, anger, and fully situated in thought of \\nme, many  have become purified by penance and knowledge of me.

The h ighest Vedic principle is to surrender unto the Supreme \\nPersonality of Godhead, Lord Krishna.  \\n \\n“Give up all other religious beliefs and just surrender unto Me [Krishna]. I \\nwill release you  from all your sins. Do not worry.” (Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -\\nGita 18. 66) \\n \\nThe Vedic knowledge is vast, superior, and comes from God.

The duration of each \\ncycle is 311 .040 trillion years (311 trillion, 40 billion years).

What are the 6 Pillars of Sanatan -Dharma (The Eternal Religion) ? \\n \\n1. Truthfulness – You must never lie, deceive, mislead, nor cheat anyone. If \\nsomeone asks you a question and you do not know or are not sure, simply \\nsay 'I don't know'. Making things up is simply lying.  \\n \\n2. Mercy – All living beings are brothers and sisters, and thus, one must be kind \\nto all his brothers and sisters. This teaching is unique to Sanatan -Dharma, \\nand it comes from the most merciful Person, Lord Krishna (God). Kindness to \\nanimals is practiced by not kil ling them (vegetarianism and no leather). Treat \\npeople equally and nicely, consider the wellbeing of everyone. Never consume \\nalcohol and drugs, gamble, nor have relationships outside of marriage, \\nbecause these cause suffering to families and especially to the women and \\nchildren. One should never engage in these sinful activities, nor associate with \\nthose who do.  \\n \\n3. Austerity – Live a simple life, don’t be materialistic, eat simply, fast, don’t \\nmake demands on others, lower your ego, chant Vedic mantras, reduc e your \\ndesires and lust, and go on pilgrimage to holy places with the will to change \\nyour nature for the better. You should sacrifice your time and money for the \\nadvancement of true religion.  \\n \\n4. Cleanliness – Take bath at least once daily, brush teeth at lea st twice daily, \\nkeep the home, business/work area, public places, rivers, and streets clean \\nby regular cleaning and not throwing trash. Don’t chew or smoke tobacco or \\nspit. Don’t put your fingers into your nose, clean with water. Don’t make \\nnoises like pig s. \\n \\n5. Charity – Donations should be given on a regular basis to accountable and \\nworthy Temples, to those engaged in the service of God, to those engaged in \\npreaching the glories and instructions of God, and to the poor.  \\n \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Spiritual Education – Without spiritu al knowledge there will be no \\nadvancement of consciousness. The Vedic knowledge is eternal and vast with \\nmore than 1,000,000 verses, compiled by God Himself in Person. They \\nprovide knowledge in all areas of life and the science of God. The Srimad \\nBhagavad -Gita is the essence of all Vedic knowledge, the word of God in \\nPerson. The Srimad Bhagavatam has the pastimes of God and His devotees; \\nthe science of material creation and other information. Only  the Vedic \\nscriptures contain information on God, including H is description, appearances, \\nand activities. One should study these two scriptures on a regular basis and \\nthen explain to others, especially to the children .  \\n“Absence of fear, purity of heart, charitable, striving for spiritual \\nknowledge by  studying the V edic scriptures, lives a simple life, \\nalways straight forward in his  dealings, always truthful, not violent, \\nfree from anger, not greedy, always gentle,  forgiving, very clean, not \\nenvious of others, compassionate to all living beings,  doesn’t talk \\nnon-sens e, has no pride, doesn’t mislead others – These are some of  \\nthe qualities of those with divine nature.\" (Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -\\nGita 16.1 -3) \\n21. Are the sinners doomed?  \\n \\nNo. Lord Krishna is very merciful and forgiving . The sinners should immediately stop \\nsinning , and worship Lord Krishna . They will be forgiven and go back to the spiritual \\nmanifestation at the end of this short life to live eternally in complete bliss.  \\n“Even if you are the greatest sinner, when you are on the boat of spiritual \\nknowledge, you  will be able to cross over the river of miseries, caused by \\nreactions to sinful activities.”  (Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -Gita 4.36)  \\nThis is yet another proof that Lord Krishna is God. He doesn’t send people to eternal \\nhell or burn people in fires. He is so ni ce that even the sinners can be saved simply \\nby stopping all sinful activities and surrendering unto Him. The main sinful activities \\nare lying, animal killing (meat eating), intoxicating (drugs, alcohol, tobacco \\nsmoking/chewing), gambling, having relations hips outside marriage, hatred, \\nviolence, anger, and greed. One should give up these sinful activities.  \\n \\n22. What scriptures should I follow?  \\nYou can follow the recently created man -made scriptures, which have limited \\nknowledge and do not describe God. Or y ou can follow the eternal Vedic scriptures, \\nwhich have vast knowledge and completely describe God. The choice is yours.  \\nLord Krishna gave the Vedic knowledge to Brahma, the first living being created in \\nthe universe, at the beginning of each cycle. In the current cycle, this was 155.522 \\ntrillion years ago. Thus,  the Vedic knowledge is eternal and comes directly from God \\n(Lord Krishna).  \\n \\n“I am telling you this ancient science of linking with the Supreme [Yoga], \\nbecause you are  My friend and devotee.

He must have appeared in the same body many times \\nand not just once. This proves that He is eternal. This is one of the differences \\nbetween God and His creations.

In a similar way, the human s are wasting this precious \\nhuman birth by engaging in all kinds of non -sense materialistic and sinful activities, \\nthinking it to be enjoyment. They forget that there is time, which is quickly taking \\naway their life and the animalistic activities of eating , sleeping, mating, defending, \\nand ignorance of God will manifest into an animal body in their next birth.

This is spiritual knowledge. To think that we are the body is \\nmaterial knowledg e. The aim of Sanatan -Dharma is to become soul conscious (we \\nare the soul), the aim of other religions is to become body conscious (they believe \\nwe are the body).  \\nTh conditioned soul in a body has two options. He can act to lord it over the material \\ncreation (materialistic life) , or he can act to go back to Godhead  (devotional service) . \\nThe choice is yours  and God does not force anyone.  \\n55. Are we all born in ignorance?  \\n \\nYes.  \\n \\n“All living beings are in utter ignorance from birth. They are deluded, due to \\nhate and  desires.

We can \\ndevelop good qualities by following the teachings of the Bhagavad -Gita which \\nincludes not engaging  in sinful acti vities like animal killing, gambling, lust, greed, \\nalcohol, drugs, and hatred . Then our mind will not be misled, and we will have good \\nchances of knowing God and engage in H is service.  \\n “Being freed from attachments, fear, anger, and fully situated in tho ught of \\nMe, many  have become purified by penance and knowledge of Me.

The result of \\nfollowing ideologies which offer se nse-gratification is that one stays in the material \\ncreation for millions of lifetimes, to satisfy  the materialistic desires. Material life \\nmeans suffering  one way or another.  One may be rich in one life and a beggar in \\nanother, healthy in one life and sev erely diseased in another. Life after life, people \\nsuffer in one form or another. This is confirmed by the person who has created the \\nmaterial creation (Lord Krishna) and this can also be confirmed by any person  in the \\nmaterial creation .

Why you should not ea t meat?  \\n  \\n* Health  – Scientific research has concluded that meat eaters are much more likely \\nto suffer from cancer, heart disease, and other diseases compared to vegetarians.  \\n \\n*  \\nMorality  – The cow gives her milk to people  as much as she can , people drink \\nher milk and then kill and eat her. This is evil.  The humans are not food for the \\nanimals, the animals are also not food for the humans. It is wrong to kill.  Why kill \\nwhen you don’t have to?  \\n \\n*  \\nEconomics  - It would take at least 146kg of vegetation, ov er 500 liters of water , \\nand many years to produce just 1 kg of beef. If cattle were not produced for \\nslaughter, then there would be at least 146kg of vegetables and more than 500 \\nliters of water for human beings to consum e. The 1 kg of beef would feed at mo st \\n2 people, and the 146kg of vegetables would feed at least 292 people . If animals \\nwere not produced for human consumption, then there would be an abundance of \\nvegetables for human consumption and the price of vegetables would be \\nextremely low and there w ould be no poverty in the world. Also, the humans \\nwould become healthier  by eating more vegetables , as confirmed by scientific \\nresearch.   \\n \\n*  \\nEnvironmental  – The breeding and killing of animals for food is leading to the \\ndestruction of forests and global warming.  \\n \\n*  \\nViolence  – The root cause of terrorism is evil ideology and the mentality of \\nviolence. The mentality of violence is created when humans kill for a living. The \\nsimple fact is that a person who cuts the throats of animals (directly or indirectl y) \\nis much more likely to cut the throats of humans too.

Do you know anyone who can be present in multiple locations at the same \\ntime?

This is another proof that Lord Krishna \\nis God, because He is the richest person. Do you know anyone who can maintain \\n16,108 homes? If you find that person, He is God.  \\n \\n66. Why did Krishna have so many wives?  \\n \\nLord Krishna was God, but He was playing the role of a Prince and in ancient times \\nall over the world, it was normal for the Kings and Princes to have many wives, this \\nis even true today in some parts of the world. \\n \\nAs a Prince , He had 8 wives and on one occasion there  were 16,100 girls who got \\nkidnapped by some demonic person. Lord Krishna got these girls released and then \\nasked the girls to go back to their homes, but the girls were too afraid to go back \\nhome. According to Vedic culture, a girl must stay with the fath er until married and \\nthen stay with the husband after marriage. If an unmarried girl spends one single \\nnight away from her father’s home without him, then the father has the right to \\nassume she has become a prostitute and reject her. If a married woman spe nds one \\nsingle night away from her husband’s home without him, then the husband has the \\nright to assume she has become a prostitute and reject her. This is Vedic culture, \\nwhich is very strict to protect women from becoming degraded.  \\n \\nThe 16,100 girls didn’ t want to go back home, because their fathers would reject \\nthem for the reasons just explained. Krishna also knew that they could not go back \\nhome, as He is the creator of the Vedic culture. Krishna asked the girls what they \\nwanted to do. The 16,100 girls asked Lord Krishna to marry them and how can Lord \\nKrishna refuse, as He is God, the one who takes care of His followers. If Lord Krishna \\nhad said no , then the lives of these girls would have been completely ruined.  This is \\nhow Lord Krishna had 16,108 wives .   \\n \\nThese days , the fathers are very proudly sending their unmarried daughters far away \\nfrom home to work or study, and most of them become degraded by having sex \\noutside marriage (boyfriends). These girls would be the rejects of society in the \\nancient world but now  days, the fathers are very proud of these degraded daughters.  \\n \\nAt the end of life, all our degrees and wealth are completely useless, because we \\ncannot take them with us. A sinless life means the soul is not degraded and after this \\nlife, the so ul moves up to a higher species with higher consciousness and not down \\ninto the animal and plant kingdoms. There are 400,000 species of human beings with \\nvarying consciousness, and 8 million species of animals and plants.

To know God \\nmeans to know His name, address, description, history dating back to millions of  \\nyears, how H e maintains and creates  millions of universes , how He witnesses all our \\nactions, His scheduled appearances and when exactly He will appear next, and so on.

Does God give us free will?  \\n \\nYes. \\n \\nThe real God (Lord Krishna) is not  a dictator nor a bully. He doesn’t force anyone to \\nfollow Him, nor does He curse those who don’t follow Him. This is because Lord \\nKrishna is responsible, mature, and doesn’t act in a childish manner. After speaking \\nthe Bhagavad -Gita to Arjuna, Lord Krishn a allows Arjuna to practice his free will. \\nArjuna is free to do as he wishes.  \\n“I have explained to you the most confidential knowledge. Now, think about \\nit and then do  as you wish.” (Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -Gita 18.63)  \\n79. Is disease and old age the killer?  \\nThe cause, place, and time of death for each person are fixed at inception of soul \\ninto the womb of a mother.  This is all based on the actions taken by us in our \\nprevious lives (karma).  \\nWe may think that people die of diseases like cancer or old age, but this is just our \\nown perception. It’s our allocated time that kills and not any disease or old age.  \\nThere are many diseased people,  but they don’t all die shortly after being diagnosed \\nwith a disease, even after many years. Some die early and some die late , thus the \\ndisease i s not the real cause of death.  \\nSome people die young and some die in old age, and thus age is not the killer. It’s \\nour own allocated time that is the real killer. At birth, the duration of life for each \\nperson is fixed in terms of the number of breaths. This is based on what the person \\ndeserves, which is based on the actions taken by the soul in his previous births \\n(karma). Once the allocated breaths are reached, the soul gets kicked out of the \\nbody, regardless of the condition of the b ody or age. This can be proven by the fact \\nthat many young and healthy people die suddenly , because their time is up. They \\nhave depleted their allocated number of breaths.

Many people say why didn’t God save them?  \\n \\nWho saved the 47,000? It was Lord Krishna (God) who saved the 47,000.

The result of free will is \\nthat some humans will become terrorists, because they become followers of evil \\nman-made  ideology and become corrupted . But Lord Krishna has a system in place \\nto control our use of free will. This is the law of nature, karma. For every action we \\ntake we will face an appropriate reaction. This is like the traffic laws in every \\ncountry. If one speed s then one will get a fine, which puts a control on speeding, as \\nmost people stop speeding because of the fines imposed. Without the fines, nobody \\nwould follow the speeding laws and there would be disaster.  \\nA doctor will prescribe the correct medicine to a diseased patient, but if the patient \\ndoes not take the medicine or makes up his own medicine then the he will not be \\ncured,  and the disease will intensify. The doctor will not force the patients to take the \\ncorrect medicine and we cannot blame the doctor  if the patient suffers more. In a \\nsimilar way, Lord Krishna has prescribed the correct medicine that will enable all \\nhumans to get through this miserable material life with minimum misery and  go back \\nto the spiritual manifestation  at the end of this short  life. In the form of the \\ninstructions in the Bhagavad -Gita and other Vedic scriptures. But if we do not follow \\nthe instructions given by Lord Krishna, then we will become corrupt and suffer more  \\nin this life and stay in the material creation, suffering li fe after life . Just like the \\nDoctors, Lord Krishna will not  force us  to follow Him, He has given us free will . Lord \\nKrishna’s credentials is that He has appeared more than 18,000 times in His original \\nform as Krishna and millions of times in His other form s. In each and every \\nappearance, He proved that He was God without any doubt.

If a person is destined to live to say 70, then Lord \\nKrishna will protect him until his time is up. Where ever the person goes, Lord \\nKrishna will make arrangements to ensure h e does not die before his due date (at 70 \\nyears).

For the civilians (those \\nnot in the military), we must do our duty according to our occupation and at the \\nsame time think of Lord Krishna.  \\n \\nLord Krishna told Arjuna to fight because  the other side wanted war and they were \\nthe bad guys.

Well, why doesn’t the unknown/invisible God of the Bible and \\nKoran stop the wars?  \\n \\nIt is very complex to understand how God and our free will play a part in wars.

How do I understand the reality of reincarnation?  \\n \\n \\n99. What does rejecting karma and reincarnation mean?  \\nSome people say they can’t remember their past lives and thus this is the only life \\n(no reincarnation). Can you remember the day you were born? No. So why do you \\nexist? Can you remember all the moments of you r whole life? No. So does this mean \\nthat you only existed for the moments you can remember?  \\nIf there is no reincarnation, then it means this is the one and only life.  \\n \\nSome people are born with cancer in their only life.  \\nSome people are born poor in their only life.  * When so meone dies, we say ‘He has passed away’. This implies that we accept that \\nthe soul and the body are different. The dead body is present before us, but the soul \\nhas passed on. Where to? Another body.  \\n* Every second living beings are dying, and every second  living beings are born. The \\nsouls in the dead bodies are being transferred to the new bodies. This is proof of the \\ntransmigration of the soul from one body to another.  \\n* In scientific terms, energy cannot be destroyed, but it changes forms. Our body is t he \\nform and we (the soul) are the energy. When this current form of ours (this body) is \\ndestroyed. We (the soul) will change our form. Thus, get a new body.  \\n* Take a look around. Why are there varieties of conscious living beings? Why is one \\nsoul in the b ody of an animal and another soul in a human body? Why is one soul in \\nthe body of a female and another in a male body? Why is one soul born in China and \\nanother born in Africa and so on? The soul is moving from one body to another, life \\nafter life. The var iation of bodies is simple proof of the transmigration of the soul \\nfrom one body to another.  \\n* The fact that God is merciful is proof of reincarnation. If God is merciful, then \\nwhy would he create some who are fortunate and some who are unfortunate in the ir \\none and only life? If after this one and only life we eternally go to hell or heaven, \\nwhich is what the non -Vedic religions preach. Then how can God be merciful to those \\nwho are eternally sent to hell for messing up their one and only life. The fact tha t God \\nis merciful is proof that he gives us unlimited chances and not just one. Thus, we (the \\nsoul) transmigrate from one body to another life after life.  \\n* If this is the only life, then why do we exist today, and some will exist in the future \\nand some e xisted in the past. The fact is that we exist today, we existed in the past, \\nand we will exist in the future too.  \\n* The body is temporary, but the soul is eternal. Accept this fact? Yes?

And just as the soul is \\ncurrently residing in this body, when this body is finished the soul will continue to \\nexist by residing in another body.  \\n* If a sinner is sent to hell forever after only one life, then how can God be forgiving \\nunless he is given another chance? The fact is that we get unlimited chances and not \\njust one. This is because God is all -merciful.  \\n* The existence of ghosts is proof that life does not end when this body dies.

Thus , the cow is the most valuable animal to the humans. It’s for \\nthis reason that Hindus consider the cow as sacred and thus give it all respects by \\ntreating her like a mother and treating her well , because she (the cow) treats \\nhumans like her own children by giving us her milk. Even though the cow is an \\nanimal, the Hindus have appreciation for her due to her contribution to the humans \\n(milk).

Don’t wa ste your time doing non -sense things, \\nengage it in the service of the proven God, Lord Krishna.  \\n \\n“Time I am..” (Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -Gita 11.32)  \\n \\nTime is one of energies of Lord Krishna. Please don’t waste Him (time).  \\n \\n116. Does Sanatan -Dharma advocate circumcision?  \\n \\nAbsolutely not. Ahimsa (non -violence) is one of the fundamentals of Sanatan -\\nDharma. Circumcision  involves violence and thus is forbidden.   \\n \\nGod has created our body the way He wants it. He did not forget to peel off \\nanything. Our body is per fect as it comes out of the womb and develops naturally. \\nThe Islamic scriptures  very clearly advocate circumcision for males and females \\n(female genital mutilation).  \\n \\n117. Does Satan really exist?  \\n \\nNo, when humans engage in violence against any living bei ng, hatred, wickedness, \\nlust, greed, anger, pride and so on, they have become Satanic. There is no species of \\nliving beings that are Satan . Any human who engages in sin is called the Satan, until \\nhe stops all sinful activities.  \\n \\nSome people foolishly stone  walls, as they think this will kill the Satan. They should \\nstone themselves whenever they engage in sinful activities like wickedness, hate, \\nviolence, intolerance to other faiths, killing of animals and so on. This is the only way \\nto kill the Satan . \\nGod d oes not create Satan  (evil, wicked, full of hate, violent, intolerant, and \\nterrorist ), rather people become satanic due to e ngaging in sinful activities and \\nfollowing evil ideologies . \\n \\n118.

Thus, a Brahmin who performs Deity service in a \\nTemple and a Sudra who cleans the floor in the Temple are both of equal standing \\nwith Lord Krishna. Both have different social work order due to different personal \\nabilities.  \\n“O son of Prtha, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower \\nbirth -women, vaisyas [merchants], as well as sudras [workers] -can \\napproach the supreme destination.” (Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -Gita 9.32)  \\nIn the above verse, Lord Krishan states that women, the vaisyas and sudras class \\ncan also approach the supreme destination if they worship Him. From a material \\npoint of view, the females are considered lower than males because they are \\nphysically weaker and thus some males will take advan tage of this. From a spiritual \\npoint of view, we are all souls and all souls are 100% equal and all souls are part of \\nthe family of Lord Krishna (God).  \\n“I hate no one. I am equal to all living beings…\" (Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -\\nGita 9.29)  \\nIn the above verse,  it is clearly stated that Lord Krishna is not partial to anyone, He \\nis equal to all.  \\nThe Caste System is authorized in Non -Vedic Scriptures  \\nThose outside India, often link the Hindu caste system with Sanatan -Dharma, but \\nthis is false, because the caste sy stem is very clearly rejected by the Sanatan -\\nDharma scriptures. The caste system is only prescribed in the non -Vedic scriptures. \\nWhich clearly state that those who do not follow their religion are automatically caste \\nfor eternal hell with no consideration for deeds. They divide humans into believers \\nand unbelievers, purely based on religion following, without any consideration for \\npious deeds, qualifications, and behavior. They even refer to those who do not follow \\ntheir religion, as untouchables.  \\nAre Some People Good from Birth or Bad from Birth?  \\nSome people do have the good qualities already developed in them from birth and \\nsome have bad qualities from birth and do not change. This is due to their \\nconsciousness development in past lives.

This means to link with Lord \\nKrishna (God), devotional service unto Lord Krishna:  \\n• Become  pure hearted. This can be accomplished by developing all the good \\nqualities t hat are described in question 121  \\n• Offer all foods that you cook first to Krishna then you can eat them \\n(parsadam). Krishna will not accept meat, fish, eggs, onions, and garlic.

This requires planting of f lower \\nbearing (especially roses) and Tulsi plants in your gardens  \\n• Perform deity worship of Radha and Krishna daily  \\n• Engage in some service at your local temple  \\n• Read the Vedic scriptures, especially the Bhagavad -Gita and Srimad -\\nBhagavatam  \\n• Preach all the abov e to others. Preaching is the highest devotional service \\nunto Lord Krishna  \\nThe above devotional service activities should be performed according to your \\ncapacity and ability, but do as much as you can, and the result will be that this will \\nbe your last mis erable material life. At death, you (the soul) will be immediately \\ntransferred to the spiritual manifestation , where you will live in the same beautiful \\nbody eternally on the same planet as Lord Narayan, an expansion of Lord Krishna, or \\non the planet of Lo rd Krishna Himself.  \\n“The great souls bow down to Me [Krishna], worship Me, and always chant \\nMy names and  glories, with determination and devotion.” (Lord Krishna, \\nBhagavad -Gita 9.14)  ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

What keeps people in ignorance?  \\n \\nNot being open minded, high personal ego, bad association, lack of proper \\nknowledge and understanding , keeps people in ignorance. Arjuna acquired the \\nknowledge of the Bhagavad -Gita to overcome his confused state. When Maharaj \\nPariksit was told he had 7 days to live, he acquired the knowledge of the Srimad -\\nBhagavatam  to make his consciousness pure before his death.  It’s the knowledge in \\nthe Vedic scriptures that will give you knowledge of God , and the knowledge to get \\nthrough this miserable material life . Which will save you from sinful activities and \\nmake your consciousness pure.  \\n \\n“Just as a blazing fire turns firewood to ashes. Knowl edge burns all \\nreactions to material  actions.” (Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -Gita 4.37)  \\n \\nAll negative qualities , such as lust, anger, violence, hatred, and greed , are nothing \\nbut a manifestation of ignorance.  \\n \\nThe difference between a good doctor and an average  one is that the good doctor \\nwill have more knowledge and understanding. A good doctor can be use ful, but the \\naverage doctor is useless in many cases.  \\n \\nIgnorance means lack of knowledge or improper knowledge or incomplete \\nknowledge. Ignorant people are eas y target for deception by the deceivers. The \\ndeceivers are also in ignorance, but they are in denial of the truth and have very \\nhigh ego. They will not question what they are taught, they will accept blindly.  \\nIgnorance will lead to being deceived applies i n religious ideologies, social \\nrelationships, and business relationships.  \\n“But those, who, out of envy, do not follow these teachings of Mine, are \\ndevoid of all good sense. Know such men as completely ignorant and \\ndoomed to ruination.” (Lord Krishna, Bhaga vad-Gita 3.32)  \\n \\n140.

The result of devotional \\nservice unto Lord Krishna (God) is that at death, the soul will be immediately \\ntransferred to the spiritual manifestation  where everyone lives in the same body that \\nis completely beautiful, full of bliss/love, full of knowledge, with no old age, no \\ndisease, and no misery.  \\n \\n“The whole cosmic manifestation is working under My direction.

Are there contradictions in the Vedic Scriptures?  \\n \\nNone.  \\n \\nSome people say there are contradictions in the Vedic scriptures because they give \\nconflicting instructions. The Vedic scriptures come from Lord Krishna (God) and He is \\nalso the creator of all humans and thus He knows that not all humans have the same \\nmentalities/abilities.

We have pre -schools, primary schools, intermediate schools, high \\nschools, colleges, universities, and so on. Not every human will be able to acquire \\nthe same level of education.  \\n \\nA good example of this is the 18 Puranas which are divided into three parts . Each \\npart is suitable for people in three categories : Goodness (Sattva Guna), Passion \\n(Rajo Guna), and Ignorance (Tamo Guna).  \\n \\nThose who are in the mode of Goodness w ill be inclined to follow the instructions in \\nthe 6 Puranas of  \\nLord Vishnu: Vishnu Purana, Naradiya Purana, Padma Purana, Garuda Purana, \\nVaraha Purana , and Bhagavata Purana . \\n \\nThose who are in the mode of Passion will be inclined to follow the instructions  in the \\n6 Puranas of Lord Brahma: Brahmanda Purana, Brahmavaivarta Purana, Markandeya \\nPurana, Bhavishya Purana, Vamana Purana , and Brahma Purana . \\n \\nThose who are in the mode of Ignorance will be inclined to follow the instructions in \\nthe 6 Puranas of Lord S hiva: Matsya Purana, Kurma Purana, Linga Purana, Shiva \\nPurana, Skanda Purana , and Agni Purana.  \\n \\nThe Bhagavad -Gita also mention s these three modes of nature: Goodness, Passion, \\nand Ignorance. All human beings are acting in one of these three modes based on \\ntheir evolved consciousness.

The women have a red dot to show that they are married  \\n \\n174. Why do Arti (ceremony of light)?  \\n \\nThe ceremony of light (Arti) involves the following before the deity of God:  \\n \\na. Waving lighted wicks which are soaked in ghee (purified butter). This signifies \\nlight (the truth). The waving is clockwise, just like the clocks. This indicates \\nprogression or advancement  of spiritual consciousness . Never anti -clockwise, \\nwhich indic ates regression or degradation  \\nb. Offering water  \\nc. Offering flowers and incense  \\nd. Waving a charmer (wisp) or white cloth  \\ne. The Arti is started and ended with the blowing of a conch -shell \\n \\n“The mind, intellect, ego, ether, air, fire, water, and earth are the eight fold \\ndivision of My  material energies. “  (Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -Gita 7.4)  \\n \\nBy performin g the Arti, we are offering the five gross material elements of creation \\nto God, to thank and remember Him  for everything He has given and done for us . \\nFire (light), water, earth (flowers), air and space ( wiping ), are the five gross material \\nelements of cr eation.  The mind, intellect, and ego are the three subtle elements . \\n \\nThe blowing of the conch signifies scarring away bad qualities , awakening the good \\nqualities, and other reasons.   \\n \\n175. Why surrender unto Lord Krishna ? \\n \\n“The divine illusionary energy of  Mine [maya] consisting of the three modes \\nof material  nature is very difficult to overcome. Those who surrender unto \\nMe can become free from  it.” (Lord Krishna, Bhagavad -Gita 7.14)  \\n \\nThe three modes of material nature are: Goodness, passion, ignorance  \\n \\nMaya, is the illusory energy of Lord Krishna, and thus we can only overcome it, by \\nHis grace. We all originate from the spiritual manifestation  and due to our own \\ndesire, we came to the material creation and the purpose of the illusory energy is to \\nkeep us in  the material creation, because that was our desire. When we surrender \\nunto Lord Krishna, we slowly transcend beyond the three modes of material nature , \\nbecome undeterred by maya,  and eventually go back to the spiritual manifestation , \\nour original home.

What abilities does Lord Krishna  have ? \\n \\nThere are eighteen superior types of mystic siddhis ( perfections ), and five inferior \\nperfections,  which Lord Krishna has in full.  \\n \\nThe eight primary perfections are as follows:  \\n \\n1) Anima -siddhi – The ability to decrease the size of one’s body and become \\nsmaller than the smallest particle. Through this siddhi one may enter into \\nstone or change th e density in one’s body, enabling one to pass through solid \\nmatter.  \\n \\n2) Mahima -siddhi – The ability to increase the size of one’s body, ultimately \\nenveloping the universe.  \\n \\n3) Laghima -siddhi – The ability to make one’s body lighter than air and fly at \\nwill. The perfection of this siddhi enables one to travel on the sun’s rays and \\nenter into the sun planet.  \\n \\n4) Prapti -siddhi – The ability to manifest any object one desires within one’s \\nhand. This siddhi removes the limitations of space which separate  two objects \\nfrom each other. It is said one will even be able to touch the moon with one’s \\nfinger [i.e. the limitation of distance is removed].  \\n \\n5) Prakamya -siddhi – The ability to attain anything one desires.  \\n \\n6) Ishita -siddhi – The ability to control the sub -potencies of the laws of nature. \\nThis enables one to control various energies and seemingly defy the laws of \\nnature. On the lowest level, one may make fire come from one’s mouth, etc.  \\n \\n7) Vashita -siddhi – The ability to bring others under one’s control.  \\n \\n8) Kamavasayita -siddhi – The ability to attain anything anywhere. This is the \\nhighest of the eight and contains most of the abilities of the other perfections.  \\n  \\n \\nThe ten secondary perfections are as follows:  \\n  ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

With this perfection o ne no \\nlonger depends on food and water for maintenance of one’s body.

With this perfection one can hear any \\nconversation spoken anywhere in the world.  \\n \\n3) The ability to see things far away. With this perfection one develops a mystic \\nvision, by which one can see any person or place. Sanjaya, the disciple of \\nVyasa, used this siddhi to see and hear the conversation between Krishna and \\nArjuna (known as Bhagava d-Gita) which took place on the battlefield of \\nKurukshetra, though he was situated far away.  \\n \\n4) The ability to travel at the speed of the mind. With this perfection one can \\ntravel great distances in a moment simply  by thinking of the destination.  \\n \\n5) The abilit y to assume any form one desires. This enables one to change one’s \\nphysical body at will.  \\n \\n6) The ability to enter the bodies of others. This perfection enables one to enter \\ninto the bodies of others and enjoy through their senses. Since ghosts do not \\nhave ph ysical senses, they often resort to this to satisfy their  desires through \\nother’s bodies.  \\n \\n7) The ability to control the time of one’s death. With this perfection one may \\nchoose the time of leaving his body.  \\n \\n8) The ability to witness the pastimes between the de migods and the  celestial \\ngirls called apsaras.  \\n \\n9) Satya -sankalpa – Perfect accomplishment of one’s determination.

Is acquiring spiritual knowledge Bhakti?  \\n  \\nYes.

Temples are not setup to give spiritual knowledge and guidance which \\npeople most desperately need. They are simply money grabbing  stores.  \\n \\nAcquiring spiritual knowledge is most important and this is real advancement of \\nconsciousness and devotional service unto God. Without reading the Bhagavad -Gita \\ndirectly or learning via others, one will not know what is taught by Lord Krishna. \\nFrom the Bhagavad -Gita we learn that Arjuna bowed down to Lord Krishna and then \\nheard His instructions.

That knowledge which cannot exist beyond this planet is called \\nnon-universal, and thus man -made knowledge.  \\nOnly the Vedic scriptures exist beyond this planet and thus the Vedic knowledge is \\nuniversal.

The stool on the face (a beard) affects the human consciousness in a \\nnegative way. A clea n-shaven face makes the person feel clean physically and \\nmentally.  \\nSwami Srila Prabhupada, a top most follower and preacher of the Bhagavad -Gita, \\ninstructed his followers not to keep beards.  \\nif one cannot afford a razor or is traveling in the jungles and t hus does not have time \\nor access to water or lives in a cave. Then it is understandable to have a beard. \\nOtherwise one should not keep stool on the face (a beard).  \\nIt’s due to degradation of human consciousness, which includes  laziness  and gross \\nignorance , that men are keeping beards thinking they look good  or wise .  \\n \\n186.

NEVER take your cell phone to Temples and                \\nKathas.  \\n➢ Don’t give your children (<16 years) a cell phone.  \\n \\nThe purpose of these silly social media accounts is simply to waste valuable time by \\nengaging you in non -sense thoughts and talks.  \\nThe purpose of the cell phone is simply to engage you in non -sense talk all day, so \\nyou waste your days and life.  \\nWhen your mind is occupied in social media and/or cell phone usage, your mind \\nbecome s more materialized.
